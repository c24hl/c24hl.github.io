	<header>you can admire the general appearance, but i'd really appreciate if the content itself was not read. thanks!</header>

	<header>ENTRY I, 12/4/20</header>
	<p>hello, this is my first journal entry. it really sucks that i'm such a procrastinator, but what sucks more are several things that are occuring very in-the-moment: first of all, i'm about to win a chess game but this stupid opponent dude won't move. but oh well, their time ran out anyway. second, my extremities are uncomfortably cold. i am not in the mood to retrieve socks or gloves. third, i need to compose and i have yet to do that. i should be doing that. now, in fact. but not really, i should really be working on this. because i've been procrastinating this for weeks. but i've done the same for my composition. i need to have something by 5pm and it is currently 2:30 and i have no time until perhaps 4:30 and half an hour is nowhere near enough unless bach decides to be nice and possess me. (if you don't know, bach was known to be a fast composer. one of the reasons i can't be bach.)</p>
	<p>on another note, i kinda dig this journal. it doesn't feel as limiting as gdocs or paper journals. and it's really easy. maybe i won't even style this. i mean, i don't like my default font, but it's simple and i like that. also, it is so cathartic that the first word of my sentence isn't automatically capitalized here. maybe that's my favorite thing. </p>
	<p>but back to composition because that's what's on my mind. i'm in the middle of writing this piece for piano that had a nice start but is really lost right now. i have no idea where it's going. it sounds pretty, but a little mushy. or like microwaved lunch. i'm also working on a piece for oboe and marimba, which has a cool premise but doesn't really function as music yet. why, you ask? well, it's supposed to be about bluebeard (it's a folktale about this dude who, shockingly, has a blue beard, and is kinda creepy but this young woman goes and says she'll marry him but there's this chamber in the house she's not supposed to enter but of course she enters and there's a bunch of dead women and blood in there so yeah it's pretty freaky), or more specifically his wife, who i'm calling pandora because she kinda is one. i even wrote this crappy poem based on the story that might go along with the piece. but i cannot, for the life of me, compose with ease. it does not come naturally. it needs to come naturally to sound natural. i hate what i have. i don't know what i want. even if i knew, i wouldn't want to write it as soon as it gets out of my mind it starts to seem and sound worse. it's worse than writer's block because you can hear the piece and hear how bad it sounds. i think eyes can lie easier than the ears. especially since i have bad eyes. these days, when i'm in a zoom or something, i start to see two of everything and i get super spaced out and then mr. headache comes in to say hi. </p>
	<p>so you see what kind of mood i'm in.</p>
	<p>ugh i'm trying to change the font and it isn't working, i'll probably fix it later. a million years later.</p>

<div class="entry2">
	<header>ENTRY II, 12/5/20</header>
	<p>I CHANGED THE FONT! AND THE BACKGROUND COLOR! im so happy omg this font is a million times better! i want to do a lot more, but first, to ear training. that's the saturday class life for you. alright, i'm in the waiting room. what i wanna do is try to make every other entry a different color, not a contrasting one like orange, but something that'll distinguish different entries. maybe a nice light blue would work. in that case, i'd need to style each div separately. let's see if i can do that.</p>
	<p>now THAT is beautiful. i even did margins and padding. and a new background color for the whole thing. it's so pretty. i love it. by the way, my ear training class has begun. i'm just not paying- oh i got called on. it's fineee. oh gosh, i really shouldn't be writing this sort of stuff here.  nothing "inappropriate," of course, but um, not really for school. more for me, i guess :)</p>
	<p>okay, my ear training class finished early. i added a warning at the top against reading, but i doubt people will actually follow that. at least this probably won't be read by more than 10 other people, those 10 being perhaps molly (my comp sci teacher this year who has introduced this whole css coding thing to me) and some curious comp sci students. as i said, though, there's really no content here that's actually deeply personal. yet, at least.</p>
	<p>i'm itching to play chess. these days it's been putting me in a mediocre mood because that's the level i am, a mediocre level, but still. i'm a bit addicted. there's a chess board on the coffee table that i sometimes just stare at when i'm working. and there's this period between when i get in bed and when i acutally get to sleep that i have, and these days, i have these flashes of chess in my mind a lot at that time. not like beth playing chess on the ceiling, of course, but just little images of satisfying moves, like a fork between a king and a queen. or a race to promotion, which i always win. anyway, i'm going to play a couple rounds now. i might come back depending on how it's going.</p>
	<p>WINNING STREAK OMG</p>
